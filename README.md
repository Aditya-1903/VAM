# VAM

Vogel’s Approximation Method (VAM) is one of the methods used to calculate the initial basic feasible solution to a transportation problem.  
VAM is an iterative procedure such that in each step, we should find the penalties for each available row and column by taking the least cost and second least cost.  
We have implemented the Vogel’s algorithm using basic list and NumPy array operations.  
We get the cost matrix, supply and demand as input from the user and then compute the transportation cost using the Vogel’s Approximation method as mentioned above.
